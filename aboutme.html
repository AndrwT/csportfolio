<p id ="display">My name is Andrew Tran and I'm 13 and a 9th grader at Summit prep.<br>
I have lived in Redwood City since i was four with my parents my older sister and my little brother.<br>
I really like reading fantasy adventure books, but my series is The Percy Jackson series. I like this series so much <br>
because it doesn't just focus on action the characters have actual personalities that aren't just stereotypes.<br>
I also enjoy playing video games with my friends, in particulaer I play League of Legends. I enjoy this game so much because<br>
It has elements of strategy and competition, but you could still just mess around and have fun(if you could get though the hate).
I was introduced to League of Legends in the middle of my 8th grade year by one of my best friends. This game is so entising<br>
because you are open enough you can meet some pretty cool people.The game is perfect if you just want to mess around and if you are super competetive.
